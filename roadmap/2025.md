# üó∫Ô∏è 2025 Learning Roadmap ‚Äì Cloudy With a Chance of Architecture

This roadmap outlines learning goals and themes for deepening software architecture knowledge throughout 2025. The goal is to build structured thinking, practical tooling skills, and strong design instincts‚Äîone concept at a time.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundations (Q2 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Understand architectural principles, patterns, and tradeoffs
- Build architectural vocabulary and mental models
- Organize notes and summaries on core topics

**Focus Areas:**
- Architecture Styles: Monolith, Microservices, Hexagonal, Event-Driven
- Key Concepts: Separation of Concerns, Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
- Design Patterns: CQRS, Saga, Circuit Breaker, Service Discovery
- Tools: Markdown, PlantUML, Structurizr, C4 Model

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Cloud & Distributed Systems (Q3 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Learn how cloud-native systems are designed and deployed
- Understand scalability, reliability, and security principles
- Get hands-on with at least one cloud provider

**Focus Areas:**
- AWS or Azure basics (IAM, VPC, ECS/Lambda, S3, API Gateway)
- Load balancing, auto-scaling, failover strategies
- Messaging systems (Kafka, SQS, Pub/Sub)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics)

---

## üéØ Phase 3: Applied Architecture (Q4 2025)

**Objectives:**
- Apply learnings through real-world designs and decision records
- Improve architectural communication (docs, diagrams, ADRs)
- Participate in or simulate architecture reviews

**Focus Areas:**
- System Design Projects (e.g., E-commerce, Notification System)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR format, pros/cons thinking)
- C4 Diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code)
- Security & Observability (JWT, API Gateway, Logs/Tracing)
