## 🔧 Key Performance Attributes

| Attribute         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Latency**       | Time to respond to a single request |
| **Throughput**    | Number of requests a system can handle per unit of time |
| **Scalability**   | Ability to handle increased load by adding resources |
| **Responsiveness**| System's ability to quickly respond to user actions |
| **Availability**  | Uptime of the system; ability to remain operational |

## 🧠 Performance Considerations

### 🏗 Architecture Design
- Choose appropriate architecture styles (e.g., monolith vs microservices)
- Minimize network hops in service interactions
- Apply caching at multiple layers (client, server, DB)

### 📦 Data Access
- Optimize database queries (indexes, batch updates)
- Use read replicas and database partitioning
- Apply CQRS for separating read/write models

### 🚅 Communication
- Prefer async over sync calls when latency-tolerant
- Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling
- Compress and batch network payloads

### ⚖️ Load Distribution
- Apply load balancing techniques (round-robin, weighted)
- Use CDN for static content
- Apply autoscaling strategies based on metrics

## 🧰 Tools for Profiling & Optimization

| Tool              | Use Case                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Apache JMeter** | Load and stress testing             |
| **Grafana + Prometheus** | Real-time performance monitoring |
| **New Relic / Datadog** | APM for profiling applications  |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Frontend performance tuning       |
| **Java Flight Recorder** | JVM profiling                  |

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

- Profile before optimizing ("measure first")
- Use caching aggressively but wisely
- Reduce synchronous communication
- Design for failure and graceful degradation
- Monitor and benchmark continuously
