# 📈 Architecture Scalability

Designing systems that grow efficiently with increasing demand.

---

## 🔍 Types of Scalability

| Type          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Vertical**   | Scaling up a machine (more CPU/RAM) |
| **Horizontal** | Adding more instances/machines |
| **Elastic**    | Dynamic scaling based on demand |

---

## 🌐 Scalability Patterns

- Load balancing (HAProxy, NGINX, ALB)
- Caching (Redis, CDN)
- Queue-based load leveling
- Database sharding and replication
- Stateless services

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Platforms

- Kubernetes for autoscaling
- AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- Azure Scale Sets
- GCP Cloud Load Balancing
- Redis/Memcached for distributed caching
