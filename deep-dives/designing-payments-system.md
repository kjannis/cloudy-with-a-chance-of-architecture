# 💸 Designing a Modern Payments System

## 🧭 Problem Scope

Design a secure, scalable payment platform that supports:
- One-time and recurring payments
- Multiple payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- Refunds, reversals, and settlements
- Audit logging and compliance

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

- Use event-driven design to decouple payment status updates
- Isolate payment gateway logic via strategy pattern
- Store payment lifecycle state in a durable state machine

## 🔐 Security

- PCI-DSS compliance: tokenize card data, never store PAN
- End-to-end encryption of payment metadata
- Webhooks verified using HMAC signatures

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

- Use sandbox gateways for integration tests
- Chaos testing for gateway outages
- Test idempotency of payment retries

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- Dashboards: success/failure rates, latency per gateway
- Alerts on transaction anomalies
- Correlation IDs for tracing issues end-to-end
